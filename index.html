    <h3>Tipovi testenina</h3>
    <p>Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1,300
        documented names.[4] In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. For example,
        the pasta form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common forms of
        pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be
        filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes</p>

    <p>As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of
        prepared dishes: as pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary
        sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo, in which the pasta is part of a
        soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno, in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is
        subsequently baked in the oven.[6]
        <br>Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation.
        Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. Other dishes
        may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture
